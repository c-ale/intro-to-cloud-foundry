# intro-to-cloud-foundry

This material is meant to support intro level learning around the Cloud Foundry platform, to be presented during the Open Source Summit 2018 in Vancouver, BC.  The slide deck provides a high level overview of the components of the platform and their functionality.  The lab section provides a short (30-45 minute) hands-on lab that allows you to experience some of the components you learned about in slides.  The labs require cloud foundry resources to run, and those will be provided to students of the class free of charge.  

If you're interested in running these labs outside of the open source summit event, the easiest way is to sign-up for a free trial of CF resources with vendors such as Pivotal Web Services or Swisscom.  See more at Cloufoundry.org.
